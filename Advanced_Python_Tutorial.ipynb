    "The collections module implements special container data types, and provides alternatives with additional functionality compared to the general collections like dictionaries, lists or tuples. So we will be talking about five different types from the collections module: The counter the named tuple, the ordered dictionary, the default dictionary, and the deque:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Counter:** The counter is a container that stores the elements as dictionary keys, and their counts as dictionary values. We can also ask for the most common element in the dictionary.\n",
    "- **Named Tuple:** The named tuples are an easy to create and lightweight object types, similar to a struct. The first argument is always the class name. The second argument are the names of the field in the class, separated by either comma or space.\n",
    "- **Ordered Dictionary:** Just like a normal dictionary, but it remembers the order in which the elements where added. Therefore we can index elements, put() and pop(). Note, that in newer Python versions, the default dictionary type also remembers the order of elements.\n",
    "- **Default Dictionary:** Is also similar to a dictionary container, with the only difference is, that it will have a default value is the keys have been not set yet, depending on the type of the dictionary it was set\n",
    "- **Deque:** Is a double ended queue, and it is used to add and remove elements from either end. This is implemented in such a way, that it is very efficient. It can be also rotated."
